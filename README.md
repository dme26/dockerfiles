# `Dockerfile`s collection
Contains `Dockerfile`s for various utility containers (including some different versions of those containers).

This repository was previously used for automated builds into the Docker Hub, but is now not building the `:latest` tags anymore.

From approximately 2020 to 2022, the `:latest` tag was what had been built from what is now named and tagged `buster-slim`.
